# Angular6
## Some common commands
### ng-new

```
ng new my-app
```
### ng-serve -- start development tool

```
ng serve --port 3000 --open
```
The Angular development tools include a feature that automatically updates the browser when there is
a change in the project. As soon as you save the index.html file, the server will detect the change and update
the application, reflecting the new content.


## Some keywords
### export
The export keyword relates to JavaScript modules. When using modules, each TypeScript or JavaScript
file is considered to be a self-contained unit of functionality, and the export keyword is used to identify
data or types that you want to use elsewhere in the application. JavaScript modules are used to manage the
dependencies that arise between files in a project and avoid having to manually manage a complex set of
script elements in the HTML file. See Chapter 7 for details of how modules work.
