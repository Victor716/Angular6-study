# Angular6
## Some common commands
### ng-new

```
ng new my-app
```
### ng-serve -- start development tool

```
ng serve --port 3000 --open
```
The Angular development tools include a feature that automatically updates the browser when there is
a change in the project. As soon as you save the index.html file, the server will detect the change and update
the application, reflecting the new content.
